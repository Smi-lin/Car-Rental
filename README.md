# CarHive

**Simplifying car sharing while ensuring secure and transparent interactions for all participants.**

---

## Project Overview

**CarHive** is a decentralized car-sharing platform designed to connect car owners with individuals seeking temporary vehicle access. Leveraging blockchain technology, CarHive removes intermediaries, ensuring trust, security, and cost-efficiency.

Car owners can list their vehicles, set rental terms, and receive payments directly via smart contracts. Renters enjoy flexible rental options, lower costs, and tamper-proof agreements, while all parties benefit from a seamless and transparent system.

## Key Features

1. **Smart Contracts for Rentals**: Automates rental agreements, tracks durations, manages payments, and enforces cancellation or late-return policies.

2. **Decentralized User Management**: Secure login and identity verification using decentralized protocols like ENS or Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE).

3. **Car Listings and Search**: Owners can list vehicles with detailed descriptions, availability, and dynamic pricing. Renters can search and filter based on location, price, and car type.

4. **Rental History Tracking**: Decentralized storage for rental history and metadata, ensuring accountability and easy retrieval.

## Why CarHive?

1. **Trust and Transparency**: Blockchain ensures immutable rental agreements and secure transactions without intermediaries.

2. **Cost-Efficiency**: Direct interaction between owners and renters reduces platform fees and overhead costs.

3. **Flexibility**: Renters can access a wide range of vehicles with personalized search and rental options.

4. **Decentralized Storage**: Metadata such as vehicle details and rental history are securely stored off-chain, protecting user privacy.

## How It Works

1. **Account Creation**: Users create accounts and verify their identities through decentralized identity protocols.

2. **Car Listing**: Owners list vehicles with details like availability, pricing, and photos.

3. **Search and Rent**: Renters browse available cars, filter by preferences, and initiate rental agreements through smart contracts.

4. **Rental Agreement**: The smart contract handles payment, rental duration, and security deposit management.

5. **Track and Review**: Users can access detailed rental history and provide ratings to enhance trust within the community.
