# 🚗 CarHive

**Simplifying car sharing while ensuring secure and transparent interactions for all participants.**

## 🌟 Project Overview

**CarHive** is a decentralized car-sharing platform designed to connect car owners with individuals seeking temporary vehicle access. Leveraging blockchain technology, CarHive removes intermediaries, ensuring trust, security, and cost-efficiency.

Car owners can list their vehicles, set rental terms, and receive payments directly via smart contracts. Renters enjoy flexible rental options, lower costs, and tamper-proof agreements, while all parties benefit from a seamless and transparent system.
